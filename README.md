# Python
Here is a collection of various projects I worked on throughout my Graduate Program at Cal Poly Pomona
My thesis project was focused around Airbnb using a month to month dataset from InsideAirbnb.com
I have many files of the descriptive and predictive analytics
I wanted to highlight some of the more interesting pieces of my work:
-deriving occupancy
-seperating amenities to run regression 
-decision tree 

In addition: 
I have added my sentiment analysis project I worked on with a few friends
- I mainly did the Vader sentiment analysis and the line charts after breaking up each book by chapter
I have also added my first semester project to identify government and private employment trends of each of the from 1977 
- This focused on mainly creating functions and classes to solve a problem.
